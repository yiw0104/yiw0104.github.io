I am a [postdoctoral research associate](https://sites.wustl.edu/peoplehealthandplaceunitstlouis/people/yi-wang/) at **Washington University’s Prevention Research Center**, leading research projects on the intersections of housing policy, eviction, and population health. My academic work has been published in *Cities*, *Housing Policy Debat*, *Socius*, and *Cities & Health*. 

# Core Research Areas

* **Landlord Behaviors**: Investigating property owner and manager behaviors, including eviction filings, housing code violations, and the use of risky home financing arrangements such as **Contract for Deed (CFD) and Rent-to-Own (RIO)**.

* **Housing Policy Impact**: Evaluating the impacts of housing policies on people's health and well-being, with a focus on the U.S. **Choice Neighborhoods Initiative (CNI)** and Brazil's **Minha Casa, Minha Vida (MCMV)** program.

Previously, I was a senior research associate on the [Evicted in Oregon](https://www.evictedinoregon.com) research team at Portland State University, where I studied evictions in subsidized housing and the implementation of the Oregon Emergency Rental Assistance Program during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

My research on [subsidized housing evictions](https://archives.pdx.edu/ds/psu/42570) has been covered by [the Oregonian/OregonLive](https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2024/09/oregon-affordable-housing-landlords-filed-thousands-of-evictions-in-recent-years-study-finds.html) and [KOIN 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0aVad4vxhk).
