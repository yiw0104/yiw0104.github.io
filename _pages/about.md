I am a [postdoctoral research associate](https://prcstl.wustl.edu/people/yi-wang/) at the Brown School of Social Work at Washington University in St. Louis. I am also a member of the [Evicted in Oregon](https://www.evictedinoregon.com) research team at Portland State University. 

I received my Ph.D. in Public Affairs with a minor in Population Studies from the University of Minnesota in 2023. Before coming to the United States, I earned my masterâ€™s degree in urban planning from Tsinghua University, China.

My research interests fall broadly in the areas of housing policy, eviction, population health, and environmental justice. My academic work in these areas is published or forthcoming in Housing Policy Debate, Cities, and Socius. 

My research on [subsidized housing evictions](https://archives.pdx.edu/ds/psu/42570) has been covered by [the Oregonian/OregonLive](https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2024/09/oregon-affordable-housing-landlords-filed-thousands-of-evictions-in-recent-years-study-finds.html) and [KOIN 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0aVad4vxhk).
