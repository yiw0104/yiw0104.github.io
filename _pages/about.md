I am a [postdoctoral research associate](https://sites.wustl.edu/peoplehealthandplaceunitstlouis/people/yi-wang/) at Washington University's Prevention Research Center. Previously, I was a senior research associate on the [Evicted in Oregon](https://www.evictedinoregon.com) research team at Portland State University, where I studied evictions in subsidized housing and the implementation of the Oregon Emergency Rental Assistance Program during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I earned my Ph.D. in Public Affairs with a minor in Population Studies from the University of Minnesota in 2023. Prior to my time in the United States, I obtained my masterâ€™s degree in urban planning from Tsinghua University in 2018.

My research interests lie at the intersection of affordable housing, eviction, and health. My academic work in these fields has been published in Cities, Housing Policy Debate, Socius, and Cities & Health. 

My research on [subsidized housing evictions](https://archives.pdx.edu/ds/psu/42570) has been covered by [the Oregonian/OregonLive](https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2024/09/oregon-affordable-housing-landlords-filed-thousands-of-evictions-in-recent-years-study-finds.html) and [KOIN 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0aVad4vxhk).
