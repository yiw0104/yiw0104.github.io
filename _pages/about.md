I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Humphrey School of Public Affairs](https://www.hhh.umn.edu/doctor-philosophy-phd-public-affairs/phd-students/yi-wang) at the University of Minnesota. I am also an alumni trainee at the [Minnesota Population Center (MPC)](https://pop.umn.edu/content/yi-wang) with a minor in Population Studies. Before coming to the United States, I earned my masterâ€™s degree in urban planning from Tsinghua University, China.

My interests are broadly in the areas of housing, migration, and health.
