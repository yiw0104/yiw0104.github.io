# 👋🏼 Welcome!

I am a [postdoctoral research associate](https://sites.wustl.edu/peoplehealthandplaceunitstlouis/people/yi-wang/) at **Washington University’s Prevention Research Center**, leading research projects on the intersections of housing policy, eviction, and population health. My academic work has been published in *Cities*, *Housing Policy Debate*, *Socius*, and *Cities & Health*.

# 🏘️ Core Research Areas

* **Landlord Behaviors**: Investigating property owner and manager behaviors, including eviction filings, housing code violations, and the use of risky home financing arrangements such as **Contract for Deed (CFD) and Rent-to-Own (RTO)**.

* **Housing and Health**: Examining the impacts of housing policies on people's health and well-being, with a focus on the U.S. **Choice Neighborhoods Initiative (CNI)** and Brazil's **Minha Casa, Minha Vida (MCMV)** program.

# 📚 Previous Research

Previously, I was a senior research associate on the [Evicted in Oregon](https://www.evictedinoregon.com) research team at Portland State University, where I studied evictions in subsidized housing and the implementation of the Oregon Emergency Rental Assistance Program during the COVID-19 pandemic.

My research on subsidized housing evictions—which found **over 5,400 eviction cases were filed in state subsidized housing from 2019 to 2023**—has been featured in major news outlets:

* **The Oregonian/OregonLive:** "[Oregon affordable housing landlords filed thousands of evictions in recent years, study finds](https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2024/09/oregon-affordable-housing-landlords-filed-thousands-of-evictions-in-recent-years-study-finds.html)"
* **KOIN 6 News (Video):** "[Oregon saw over 5K recent affordable housing eviction filings, PSU finds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0aVad4vxhk)"
    * *The report highlighted that **one in every 10 evictions** is a person living in low-income subsidized housing and that these subsidized tenants were **more likely to receive an eviction judgment** compared to those in unsubsidized housing.*
