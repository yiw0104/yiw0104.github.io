I am a postdoc at the Brown School of Social Work at Washington University in St. Louis. I am also an ajunct research associate on the [Evicted in Oregon](https://www.evictedinoregon.com) team at Portland State University. I received my Ph.D. in Public Affairs with a minor in Population Studies from the University of Minnesota in 2023. Before coming to the United States, I earned my masterâ€™s degree in urban planning from Tsinghua University, China.

My research interests fall broadly in the areas of housing justice, urban planning, and population health.
