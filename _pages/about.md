I am a senior research associate on the [Evicted in Oregon](https://www.evictedinoregon.com) team at Portland State University. I received my Ph.D. in Public Affairs from the University of Minnesota in 2023. I am also an [alumni trainee at the Minnesota Population Center (MPC)](https://pop.umn.edu/content/yi-wang) with a minor in Population Studies. Before coming to the United States, I earned my masterâ€™s degree in urban planning from Tsinghua University, China.

My research interests fall broadly in the areas of housing, urban (re)development, and population health.
