## 👋 Welcome

I am a **Postdoctoral Research Associate** at **Washington University’s Prevention Research Center** in St. Louis. My research is dedicated to understanding the complex, systemic intersections of **housing policy, eviction, and population health**.

My academic work employs quantitative and spatial analysis to inform equitable policy solutions, with a focus on vulnerable populations. Findings have been published in journals such as *Cities*, *Housing Policy Debate*, *Socius*, and *Cities & Health*.

## 🔬 Core Research Areas

My research program is built around two primary, interconnected themes:

### 1. Landlord-Tenant Dynamics & Housing Stability
Investigating the structural factors that shape property owner and manager behavior, and their downstream effects on housing stability.

* **Eviction and Housing Code Violations:** Analyzing the patterns and determinants of eviction filings and housing code non-compliance.
* **Informal Home Financing:** Studying the prevalence and impact of risky housing arrangements like **Contract for Deed (CFD) and Rent-to-Own (RTO)** on low-income households.

### 2. Housing Policy & Population Health
Examining the causal impacts of large-scale housing and neighborhood development policies on individual and community health and well-being.

* **U.S. Choice Neighborhoods Initiative (CNI):** Evaluating the health and equity outcomes associated with neighborhood revitalization efforts.
* **Brazil's Minha Casa, Minha Vida (MCMV):** Assessing the long-term health and social impacts of this national social housing program.

## 📚 Previous Research: Evicted in Oregon

Prior to my current role, I served as a Senior Research Associate on the highly-cited **Evicted in Oregon** research team at Portland State University. My work there focused on eviction patterns within subsidized housing programs and evaluating the implementation of the Oregon Emergency Rental Assistance Program during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Media Coverage Highlights
My research on subsidized housing evictions—which found **over 5,400 eviction cases were filed in state subsidized housing from 2019 to 2023**—has been featured in major news outlets:

* **The Oregonian/OregonLive:** "[Oregon affordable housing landlords filed thousands of evictions in recent years, study finds](https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2024/09/oregon-affordable-housing-landlords-filed-thousands-of-evictions-in-recent-years-study-finds.html)"
* **KOIN 6 News (Video):** "[Oregon saw over 5K recent affordable housing eviction filings, PSU finds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0aVad4vxhk)"
    * *The report highlighted that **one in every 10 evictions** is a person living in low-income subsidized housing and that these subsidized tenants were **more likely to receive an eviction judgment** compared to those in unsubsidized housing.*
