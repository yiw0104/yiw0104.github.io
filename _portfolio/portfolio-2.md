The dependence of the economy on fossil fuels and the lack of stringent policies to extensively implement renewable energy is an issue to be tackled at national level in the Netherlands.  Reducing emissions, while making the shift to renewable energy and changing the existing energy systems towards a sustainable model has been discussed widely. This shift can only be possible with a strategic plan defining the role of all involved stakeholders. Spatially, we can prepare for this transition by creating conditions for this change to occur in the future. This involves exploring synergies between the environment, economic and social conditions that contribute to the growth of the green energy economy. The project demonstrates this by proposing a strategic plan for the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area (AMA) to develop energy transition landscapes.
