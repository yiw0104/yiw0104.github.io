This study examines changes in elements considered essential for developing livable cities, as identified by researchers and practitioners in urban planning, public health, and related fields in the United States. Data were collected in 2017 and 2024, using Concept Mapping surveys, which integrates diverse opinions through brainstorming, sorting, and rating phases. The findings reveal that environmental sustainability has emerged as a high-importance element, while racial and economic justice continues to be perceived as the least important and the least feasible element. The results highlight the need for an integrated approach that balances short-term built environment goals with long-term equity measures.
